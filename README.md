# Insta-Pulse_Arduino
This is a "Hello World" sketch for communicating with the Insta-Pulse 105 with 5v TTL pulse output.

It demonstrates connecting an Arduino UNO to the Insta-Pulse 105 with 5V TTL pulse output, triggering an LED to blink with each heartbeat, and calculating beats-per-minute (BPM) using the inter-beat interval (IBI).
